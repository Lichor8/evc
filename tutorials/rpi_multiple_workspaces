To set up multiple desktops do the following:

1. Click Menu,
2. Then Preferences;
3. Then Windows Settings;
4. From the Configuration manager choose Desktops in the left hand column;
5. Select the desired Number of Desktops;
6. Then click Close.

You now have multiple desktops, However, the GUI does not give any indication of this and you need to remember the keyboard shortcuts to use them: Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right will switch to the next desktop. To make this more usable do the following:

1. Right Click on the menu bar at the top of the screen;
2. Select Add/Remove Panel Items;
3. Select the Panel Applets Tab;
4. Click the Add button;
5. Choose Desktop Pager from the list;
6. Optional, choose Desktop Number/Workspace Name;
7. Click Close.

This will add a panel applet to the menu bar (far right by default) that will allow you to click and switch between the desktops.
